Welcome to my implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 

The playgame file consists of a sample game. Functionality exists for any nxn game board.

Requires Ruby to run. Unit tests can be found in the tests.rb file.

Note: This is a draft. Code is being refactored for superior design. Play is currently limited to a single turn, and functionality for an arbitrary number of turns is being added.
